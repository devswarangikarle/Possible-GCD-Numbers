# Possible-GCD-Numbers
 1) The sum a+b lies between l and r inclusive. 2) The greatest common divisor(GCD) of a and b isn't 1. are possible or not? If no such numbers exist, print "No" else print "Yes". Input contains two integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^6). Output Print "Yes" if it's possible to find two numbers satisfying both the conditions, "No"
